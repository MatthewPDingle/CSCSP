Buy/Sell Criteria
- More Alpha Normalized
- Metric about winners / losers ratio
- Metric of a stocks % rank in its group. 0-100

Bugs
- Different number of cells on axis don't align right
- Concurrent modification exception when drawing cells in MapCellPanel class
- Tooltip mouseover location doesn't always work with weird resolutions
- Sometimes cell flickering
- Queries in QueryManager should close on error
- Make sure the same maps come out the same when run at different times.
- GeneticSearcher still isn't saving maps right?
- tradingaccounthistory isn't guaranteed to update correctly (and in fact usually does not) because it gets the latest price for each position from basicr, and in many cases that hasn't been updated with real-time data.

Other Stuff to Add or Change
- Input validation
- Could change the resolution in real time if you stored all the map query results in memory
- In memory DB
- GUI options to set what a "good" map is before you run the Eval button
- Simulate a larger time frame and without filters and let the filters change the map as the user changes them.  Simulation period could be date range sliders or something.  Have some calculation to show how resilient to change the map is.  If a map this month looks similar to a map last month, that's good.
- Make a copy of basicr & metric tables with random walk values in them to make sure nothing too great can be found by the genetic searcher
- Make a smooth animation to new location for map symbols
- Value at Risk & Modern Portfolio Theory.  Look for a java non-linear solver.
- Ideally my stop exit criteria would be something like waiting up to 20 days for the sell criteria to hit.  If it doesn't, dont' simply use a "sell after 20 days" cutoff, change it to something like "sell when williamsr10 rises above 50" - something that will hit quickly.
- Do I want do exit a position if I find that it appears in a high priority zone on an opposite map?
- Also, do I want to keep a position that gets an exit criteria if it's still in a HP zone?



New Stuff
- More Bar Type Metrics
- Data downloaders for bitfinex, bitstamp, kraken, btc-e, forex
- Would be nice to be able to view charts and metrics by clicking on a cell
- Use of numtrades and vwap fields in bar data (maybe probably not)

TODO
- Memory leak when running GeneticSearcher
- pricebolls metrics have suspiciously symmetrical values +/-
- Multi-thread BarCreator.
- Have BarCreator have a parameter so it can start at the point of the most recent existing bar instead of at the first tick.
- Put some kind of MetricDiscreteValueHash calculation option on DataManager
- Position Size in QueryManager using relative volatility (Used to use mvol100)
- Metrics with longer time periods
- Metric values that are the first derivatives of regular ones
- Downloading multiple sized bars at the same time doesn't work well
- Write method to turn the OKCoin ticker channel into bars - seems faster and more reliable than kline bar channels.  Also don't have to subscribe to as many channels.  Not sure of feasibility given volume 
- Have some true partial bars going back to 9/21 - need to clean out the bars and metrics sometime
- Might have to change MetricFunctions to not set the value if it's already set
- Try out OKCoin Fix API
- Instances in ARFF data need weights when there's a heavy skew towards one classification over the other
- Have to finish support for Normalized Numeric values by storing the Normalizer and using it in TradingThread (line ~125) to evaluate new data.
- Breakout metrics have poor metricdiscretevalues.  Should they be used?


Model types
- Shorter timeframe & fewer metrics, Longer timeframe & more metrics
- Variations of metrics
- Variations of algorithms
- Using different bar durations
- Combining symbols across exchanges and using exchange name as another feature

Bugs
- RSI and some other metrics might have bad values at times when the real-time downloader starts up.  This *might* be fixed since I changed loadMetricSequenceHash to not also include partial bars.
- Check to make sure there are no orphan partial bars.
- Still getting disconnects on OKCoin WebSocket API
- Sometimes it looks like new OKCoin WebSocket bars aren't triggering recalculation/updates.
- ModelManagement fucks up when you have selected rows and do a search and then weird rows get selected or something
- RealtimeDownloaderServlet looks to see if the REST API downloaded at least one bar before starting the WebSocket API.  Zero bars is completely valid if there are actually zero new ones.  Change this check.
